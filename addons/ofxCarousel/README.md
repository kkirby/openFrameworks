ofxCarousel
===========

ofxCarousel is a generic carousel/slideshow/scroll controller for openFrameworks. It handles velocity, deceleration and bounce (or wrap). 

Hook it up to your preferred input (mouse, keyboard, leap, etc...) and then draw something using the ```position``` property or the ```positionForTile``` method which make working with tiles really simple.
